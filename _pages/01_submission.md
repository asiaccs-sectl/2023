Areas of interest include (but not limited to):

* Adversarial/poisoning attacks against deep learning tasks
* Defenses to improve deep learning system robustness
* Privacy-preserving deep learning systems and protocols
* Secure computation based solutions for deep learning training and inference
* Privacy inference attacks against deep learning systems, e.g., membership inference, model extraction, model inversion
* Intersection among fairness, privacy, robustness, explainability, accountability, and environmental wellbeings in deep learning systems
* Trustworthy deep learning systems for domain specific applications, e.g., energy, medical AI, smart manufacturing, etc.
* Secure federated systems for decentralised deep learning
* Security and privacy in on-device deep learning systems and applications

Position papers describing the work in progress are also welcome.
