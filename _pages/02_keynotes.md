<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Machine learning has made tremendous progress during the past decade. While improving our daily lives, recent research shows that machine learning models are vulnerable to various security and privacy attacks. In this talk, I will cover our three recent works in this field. First, I will talk about some recent development in membership inference. Second,  I will present link stealing attacks against graph neural networks. In the end, I will introduce model hijacking attacks.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> The outstanding performance of deep neural networks has promoted deep learning applications in a broad set of domains. However, the potential risks caused by adversarial samples have hindered the large-scale deployment of deep learning. In these scenarios, adversarial perturbations, imperceptible to human eyes, significantly decrease the modelâ€™s final performance. Many prior works have been published on adversarial attacks and their countermeasures in the realm of deep learning. It is difficult to evaluate the real threat of adversarial attacks or the robustness of a deep learning model, as there are no standard evaluation methods. Hence, with this talk, we attempt to offer the first analysis framework for a systematic understanding of adversarial attacks. The framework is built from the perspective of cybersecurity so as to provide a lifecycle for adversarial attacks and defences. In addition, we provided a case study to show the defense on an deep learning attack in this framework.</p>
