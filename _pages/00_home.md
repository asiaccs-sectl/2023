The inaugural AsiaCCS 2023 Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Deep Learning Systems (SecTL) aims to establish a new platform that interconnects deep learning and trustworthy systems. SecTL expects to gather researchers from academia and industry to discuss the latest advances and future directions in designing, deploying secure and trustworthy deep learning systems for real-world applications and services. In this workshop, we solicit research papers, position papers, and working-in-progress papers to investigate best practices, new methods, and secure design principles for deep learning systems.
