The inaugural AsiaCCS 2023 Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Deep Learning Systems (SecTL) aims to establish a new platform that interconnects deep learning and trustworthy systems. SecTL expects to gather researchers from academia and industry to discuss the latest advances and future directions in designing, deploying secure and trustworthy deep learning systems for real-world applications and services. In this workshop, we solicit research papers, position papers, and working-in-progress papers to investigate best practices, new methods, and secure design principles for deep learning systems.

Areas of interest include (but not limited to):

* Adversarial/poisoning attacks against deep learning tasks 
* Defenses to improve deep learning system robustness
* Privacy-preserving deep learning systems and protocols
* Secure computation based solutions for deep learning training and inference
* Privacy inference attacks against deep learning systems, e.g., membership inference, model extraction, model inversion
* Intersecion among fairness, privacy, robustness, explainability, accountability, and enviromental wellbeings in deep learning systems
* Trustworthy deep learning systems for domain speciÔ¨Åc applications, e.g., energy, medical AI, smart manufacturing, etc.
* Secure federated systems for decentralised deep learning
* Security and privacy in on-device deep learning systems and applications
